# Ad Analytics System Documentation

## Overview

The RiseUp platform includes a comprehensive ad analytics system that tracks, measures, and reports on advertising performance across banner and audio ads. This document explains how the system works, what each metric means, and how revenue is tracked and distributed.

## Key Metrics Explained

### 1. Impressions
**Definition**: The number of times an ad is displayed to users.

**How it's tracked**:
- Recorded when an ad is successfully loaded and displayed on a user's screen
- Tracked via frontend JavaScript events that fire when ads become visible
- Stored in the `ad_impressions` collection with timestamp, adId, adType, and user information

**Who controls it**: Automatic tracking by the ad serving system

**Importance**: Base metric for all other calculations - represents ad reach and visibility

### 2. Clicks
**Definition**: The number of times users click on an ad.

**How it's tracked**:
- Recorded when users interact with clickable elements in ads
- Tracked via click event handlers on ad components
- Stored in the `ad_clicks` collection with timestamp, adId, adType, and user information
- Includes click-through URLs and conversion tracking

**Who controls it**: User interaction + automatic tracking

**Importance**: Measures user engagement and interest in the advertised content

### 3. Click-Through Rate (CTR)
**Definition**: The percentage of impressions that result in clicks.

**Formula**: `(Clicks ÷ Impressions) × 100`

**How it's calculated**:
- Computed dynamically from impression and click data
- Updated in real-time as new data comes in
- Displayed as a percentage in the analytics dashboard

**Who controls it**: Calculated automatically by the analytics system

**Importance**: Measures ad effectiveness and user engagement quality

### 4. Revenue
**Definition**: The total money generated from ad interactions.

**How it's tracked**:
- Revenue is calculated based on different pricing models:
  - **CPM (Cost Per Mille)**: Revenue per 1,000 impressions
  - **CPC (Cost Per Click)**: Revenue per click
  - **CPA (Cost Per Action)**: Revenue per desired action (conversions)

**Revenue Sources**:
1. **Direct Ad Sales**: Revenue from advertisers paying for ad placements
2. **Ad Network Revenue**: Revenue from third-party ad networks (Google AdSense, etc.)
3. **Sponsored Content**: Revenue from sponsored songs/playlists

**Storage**: Revenue data is stored in the `ad_revenue` collection with amount, source, adId, and timestamp

### 5. Revenue Trends
**Definition**: Historical revenue data showing performance over time.

**How it's tracked**:
- Revenue is aggregated by day/week/month
- Shows revenue progression and seasonal patterns
- Helps identify successful campaigns and optimization opportunities

**Current Implementation**:
- Revenue trend data is currently simulated with mock data
- Real implementation would aggregate from `ad_revenue` collection
- Shows daily revenue, impressions, and clicks over time periods

## Ad System Architecture

### Components

#### 1. Frontend Ad Components
- **BannerAd Component**: Displays banner ads with click tracking
- **AudioAd Component**: Handles audio ad playback and interaction
- **AdAnalyticsDashboard**: Displays performance metrics and trends

#### 2. Backend Storage Layer
- **AdStorage Class**: Manages all ad-related database operations
- **Collections**:
  - `ad_campaigns`: Campaign information and settings
  - `audio_ads`: Audio ad content and metadata
  - `banner_ads`: Banner ad content and metadata
  - `ad_placements`: Where and how ads are displayed
  - `ad_impressions`: Impression tracking data
  - `ad_clicks`: Click tracking data
  - `ad_revenue`: Revenue tracking data

#### 3. API Layer
- **Ad Routes**: RESTful endpoints for ad management
- **Analytics Routes**: Data aggregation and reporting endpoints
- **Authentication**: Role-based access control (admin vs regular users)

### Data Flow

```
1. Ad Creation → 2. Ad Placement → 3. User Interaction → 4. Tracking → 5. Analytics
```

#### Step 1: Ad Creation
- Admin creates ads through the management panel
- Ads are stored with metadata (title, content, targeting, etc.)
- Automatic placement creation for banner ads

#### Step 2: Ad Placement
- Ads are placed on different pages (home, discover, etc.)
- Targeting rules determine which users see which ads
- Priority system controls ad rotation

#### Step 3: User Interaction
- Users view ads (impressions recorded)
- Users click ads (clicks recorded)
- User behavior tracked for optimization

#### Step 4: Tracking
- Frontend events send data to backend
- Data stored in respective collections
- Real-time processing and aggregation

#### Step 5: Analytics
- Data aggregated for dashboard display
- Performance metrics calculated
- Revenue trends analyzed

## Revenue Distribution System

### Revenue Sharing Model

#### Platform Revenue (70%)
- Covers operational costs
- Platform development and maintenance
- Marketing and user acquisition
- Profit margin

#### Artist Revenue (30%)
- Distributed to content creators
- Based on song performance and ad revenue attribution
- Paid out monthly or quarterly

### Revenue Attribution

#### How Revenue is Attributed to Artists:
1. **Song-Level Attribution**: Revenue from ads shown during specific songs
2. **Artist-Level Attribution**: Revenue distributed based on artist's overall contribution
3. **Performance-Based**: Higher-performing songs get more revenue share

#### Process:
1. Ad revenue is generated from user interactions
2. Revenue is attributed to specific songs/ads
3. Artist share (30%) is calculated
4. Revenue distributed to artist accounts
5. Monthly payouts processed

## User Targeting and Personalization

### Targeting Options

#### 1. User Type Targeting
- **FREE users**: Basic targeting for free tier users
- **PREMIUM users**: No ads shown (ad-free experience)
- **ARTIST users**: Special targeting for creator accounts

#### 2. Device Targeting
- **Mobile**: Optimized for mobile devices
- **Desktop**: Optimized for desktop browsers
- **Tablet**: Tablet-specific ad formats

#### 3. Geographic Targeting

#### 4. Behavioral Targeting

### Ad Serving Logic

#### Priority System:
1. **High Priority**: Premium advertiser campaigns
2. **Medium Priority**: Regular campaigns
3. **Low Priority**: House ads and promotions

#### Rotation Logic:
- Round-robin rotation for equal campaigns
- Performance-based weighting (better performing ads shown more)
- Frequency capping to prevent ad fatigue
